**Postural Instability and Fall Risk in Welders: An ICF-Informed Approach to Risk Stratification**

Chronic welding exposure is associated with neurotoxic injury and secondary parkinsonism (manganism), yet postural instability and fall risk remain poorly characterized. This study evaluates balance impairment and fall history in welders using an International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF)–informed, multivariate analytical framework.

## Abstract
**Objective.** Welding exposure is associated with secondary parkinsonism (manganism) and long-term neurological dysfunction, including auditory–vestibular impairment. However, postural instability and fall risk in welders remain understudied. This study aimed to quantify balance impairment and fall risk in welders and to evaluate whether integrating personal and environmental factors within the ICF framework improves characterization of fall history.  

**Methods.** Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to derive latent composite scores for balance performance, occupational exposure, and personal protective equipment (PPE) use. These components were entered into Firth penalized logistic regression models to assess associations with fall history while accounting for small-sample bias. Factorial analysis of mixed data (FAMD) was used to integrate continuous and categorical variables and to visualize multivariate structure.  

**Results.** Welders demonstrated significantly worse balance and fall-related confidence compared with controls. The full multivariable model incorporating age, balance, exposure, and PPE indices showed the best overall fit, with age emerging as the strongest independent predictor of fall history.  

**Conclusion.** Welders exhibit clinically meaningful balance impairments within a multifactorial exposure–health context, supporting ICF-informed, exposure-aware screening and targeted balance interventions.
